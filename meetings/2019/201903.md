## Details

The 2009 DXpedition to Desecheo Island - K5D is brought to you from a small, uninhabited islet of the archipelago of Puerto Rico located in the northeast of the Mona Passage. It has a land area of only .59 sq. mi. Desecheo has no known bodies of surface water and reaches a maximum elevation of 715 ft. It is most inhospitable!

Bob, K4UEE and Ed, W4ZSB have produced yet another exciting DXpedition video! In the tradition of previous video productions, the K5D DXpedition video, entitled, "Desecheoâ€¦ so rare, so near, yet so far" is full of exciting footage of the helicopter trips, the island from the air, camp set up and takedown, QSO pileups you won't believe and an inside look into the logistics of big DXpeditions. Featured interviews with key team members add human interest and of course, humor abounds.

Amateur Radio DXpeditions are exciting events to watch. Order your own copy of 2009 DXpedition to Desecheo Island - K5D, from DX Engineering, and share the excitement!
