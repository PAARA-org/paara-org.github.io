## Details

Join us Friday, January 4, 2019 PAARA meeting at Cubberley Community Center, Room H-6 for HOMEBREW NIGHT.  No, it has nothing to do with beer.  We want to see what youâ€™ve been building or toying with in your workshop.  Anything ham or electronics related is great.  Bring and show off what you have built.
