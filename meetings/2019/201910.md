## Details

Shrikumar KA6Q: I have been a Ham Radio enthusiast for over 36 years, and a licensed Ham for about 36 weeks. Since I grew up in a negative-20 year time-warp in my high-school days, and thence transplanted to Silicon Valley at the temporal edge of civilization, I am just as comfortable with valves viz. as ECC81, (translation ... "electron tubes, like 12AT7"), as I am with ML-engines implemented in 14nm FinFETs. My favourite [sic] bed-time reading material has ranged from the Lenkurt Demodulator to Running Light Without Overbyte.

In this informal talk, I would like to share a sneak-peek from something that's currently cooking on my lab-bench, when I set out to build something specifically because it seems impossible. During this journey, I learned about innovations that had been made way back in the 30s and 40s, which somehow seemed to have been forgotten by Hams in all the intervening years. One example relates to SSB that can be demodulated by plain AM radios, known as CSSB, or Compatible Single Side Band. And a second related one is, how, despite widely-held conventional Ham wisdom, you can indeed boost SSB signals with a saturating power amplifier that is most definitely not linear."
