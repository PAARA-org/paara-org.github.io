## Details

What started as a few ideas to help grow the Tehachapi Amateur Radio Association quickly turned into a phone call: “You’re our new Public Information Officer.” 

Since then, I’ve leaned into my photojournalism background and community pride to make TARA not just visible—but unforgettable.

In this presentation, I’ll share how showing up in person, radio in hand and TARA logo patch proudly worn, has transformed our club’s visibility.

From grand openings and Chamber luncheons to Economic Development Council meetings, I’ve made it a point to be everywhere—because a personal visit leaves an impression no flier ever could.

With support from Clare at the Tehachapi Chamber of Commerce and a commitment to saying “yes” to every opportunity, TARA has become a fixture at:

- Applefest  
- Mountain Festival  
- Ghoulden Hills Trick or Treat 
- Downtown Treat Trail 
- Health & Safety Fairs  
- Organization support
- Business grand openings  

Our Halloween Photo Booth has become a cherished tradition for local families, and our visibility has led to invitations from organizations seeking our help with logistics, safety, and event planning. 

Even our Field Days are bursting at the seams—because when you show up consistently, the community starts showing up for you.

This isn’t just a story about radios—it’s about resonance. About how a club can become a community partner, one event, one conversation, one patch-covered hat at a time.
