## Details

In his own words:

> In March 2019 I gave up the Vice Director slot so that I could take on the administration of the new ARRL/FCC Volunteer Monitor program for the ARRL.  This is a new phase of FCC cooperation and enforcement in the Amateur Service.  As of November 20, 2021 the Volunteer Monitor program is up and running!  We have around 160 Volunteer Monitors who began monitoring in March 2020.  To date they are averaging several thousand hours a month listening to our bands--HF and other frequencies.  Our goal is for Amateur radio to last 100 years and remain an important part of the American communications infrastructure.

> I was first licensed in 1961 in SC as KN4ZDH, and I remember my first contact as if it were yesterday.  Retired from FCC in 2008, and for the ten years prior to that it was my privilege to administer the FCC's enforcement program in the Amateur Radio Service.  I enjoyed every day of my career at the FCC, but the Amateur Radio enforcement period was the greatest privilege of my life and gave me an opportunity to pay back in some way all of the joys and rewards Amateur Radio gave me.
