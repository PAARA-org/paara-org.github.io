## Details

Richard Dillman [W6AWO](https://www.qrz.com/db/W6AWO), President of the **Maritime Radio Historical Society**, shares the story of the pioneering radio stations built by the American Marconi Company in 1914. These stations, with powerful transmitters in Bolinas and a mile-long receiving antenna in Marshall, were engineered to send and receive signals across the Pacific.
