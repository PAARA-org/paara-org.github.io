## Details

A random wire with a small manual tuner can be an effective antenna setup for portable operations. Add a portable network analyzer or small VNA to your kit and tuning can be made more precise, but is still a matter of trial and error, albeit guided. In this presentation we describe a method for going straight to the optimum tuner settings, giving a previously-gathered one-time characterization of the tuner and a one-time sweep of the antenna. This method is an adaptation of Melville and Hamilton, "Silent Tuning: Matching a transmitter to an antenna without emitting a signal"  (MILCOM 2021).

Dr. Stillinger was originally licensed in the 1970's as WN2EFI -- passed the 5 wpm code test -- but it lapsed before even making it into the callbook. About two years ago she rediscovered ham radio as a great way to make friends, hike around parks, and have fun tinkering together.  She enjoys operating all modes on HF ranging from CW through Hellschreiber to SSTV.
