## Details

Homebrew Night will take place during our March 7th meeting; so start building now!

From hardware to software, simple to complex. It doesn't matter. If you put your heart and soul into it then show it off at the March meeting! It is strongly suggested that you make your presentation in person to facilitate a better viewing experience. If you present via Zoom then it may work better if you make a PDF file of pictures and any supporting text and share that so you don't have to fumble trying to get the item(s) in the camera view.
