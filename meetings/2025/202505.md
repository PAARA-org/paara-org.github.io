## Details

Carlos Felix, US Amateur Radio Callsign K9OL, US Parachute Association license D-36519.

I became a licensed skydiver in 2012, a radio amateur in 2019. I love experimenting with radio and skydiving/parachuting gives me a great platform to test things from. In the winter when I can't skydive, I go play with my radio at POTA parks in the area to have fun and test new gear.
