## Details

Homebrew Night will take place during our March 6th meeting; so start building now!

From hardware to software, simple to complex. It doesn’t matter. If you put your heart and soul into it then show it off at the March meeting! It is strongly suggested that you make your presentation in person to facilitate a better viewing experience. If you present via Zoom then it may work better if you make a PDF file of pictures and any supporting text and share that so you don’t have to fumble trying to get the item(s) in the camera view.

### Homebrew Registration

In an effort to streamline the sign ups, please complete the [**signup form**](https://forms.gle/oyaL7xuQq1yKaKnP7){:target="_blank"} and then submit it.

Due to time constraints, We are only accepting 10 participants, and each participant will have 5-7 minutes to talk about their homebrew project. Remember, this is a show and tell not a full presentation.
