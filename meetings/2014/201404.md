## Details

Welcome!
Welcome to the Palo Alto Amateur Radio Association, "The Friendliest Club Around."

We are the premier San Francisco Bay Area general interest Amateur Radio club.  I'd like to personally thank you for stopping by.  PAARA is a general interest club that actively encourages its members to enjoy our multi-faceted hobby together with friends.

We hope that you will be able to learn about our club here, and invite you to stop by one of our meetings.  I think you'll find that we live up to our motto.

If you are a new ham, or an old timer with a desire to meet other interesting and fun hams, please come visit us in person.  We hope to see you soon!
