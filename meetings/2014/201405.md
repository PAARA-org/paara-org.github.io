## Details
Jim was first licensed as WN8FNI in 1955, W8FNI a year later, and Extra in 1959. Jim was mostly inactive after college, raising a family and running his own small business. Until moving to Santa Cruz in 2006, all of his hamming has been with simple antennas on small lots and low power. Now retired to the Santa Cruz Mountains, he's been building and enjoying the station and antenna farm of his wildest dreams. This talk focuses on simple antennas for limited space, limited skyhooks, and limited budgets.
