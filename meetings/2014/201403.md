## Details

Microcontroller technology has exploded in popularity among ham radio operators. The new generation of single-board microcontrollers is easier than ever to use, bringing together hardware and software for project-building most radio amateurs can easily dive into. With inexpensive microcontroller platforms – such as the popular open-source Arduino board – along with readily available parts, components and accessory boards, the possibilities are limitless: beacon transmitters, keyers, antenna position control, RTTY and digital mode decoders, waterfall displays, and more.

Leigh WA5ZNU is editor of ARRL's new book Ham Radio for Arduino and Picaxe, and a contributor to open-source ham radio software packages such as fldigi and quisk. Leigh has been licensed since age 7, and operates on HF and VHF/UHF.
