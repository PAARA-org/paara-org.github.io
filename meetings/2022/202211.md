## Details

There are many reasons for controlling and operating an HF station
remotely. There are also almost as many different ways to implement the remote rig control.

In this presentation we'll take a look at the different methods, with a more detailed look at an implementation based on the Remoterig hardware.

We'll also do a live demo using my OH1G remote station in Finland.
