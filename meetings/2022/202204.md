## Details

Brian will be discussing what Pico-Ballooning is and how it differs from other types of High Altitude Balloons (HAB's). I will also go over the basics of a complete balloon as launched as well as a number of common options. I will then talk about Ham Radio and the key role it plays in this hobby. Finally I'll finish up discussing our recent launches from QuartzFest in AZ.

I'm an Extra Class operator, Assistant DEC for ARES High Desert (LAX Section), VP of the Acton Agua-Dulce ARC and I work as a Hydroelectric Power plant Technician. I also manage two Winlink Gateways and I am trustee for two local repeaters.
