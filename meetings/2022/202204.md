## Details

Brian will be discussing what Pico-Ballooning is and how it differs from other types of High Altitude Balloons (HAB's). I will also go over the basics of a complete balloon as launched as well as a number of common options. I will then talk about Ham Radio and the key role it plays in this hobby. Finally I'll finish up discussing our recent launches from QuartzFest in AZ.
