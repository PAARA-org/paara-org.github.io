# Software Antenna Modeling

* **Date**: `July 8, 2022`
* **Time**: `07:00 PM Pacific Time`
* **Topic**: `Software Antenna Modeling`
* **Presenter**: `Fred Cirera, W6BSD`

## Details

In this presentation, Fred will demonstrate the software he uses to design or learn how antennas work. During the presentation, we will build an antenna and see how changing some parameters affects the antenna's radiation pattern and impedance. Using different software, we will figure out the most efficient way to send all the power from the radio to the antenna.

Fred (W6BSD) is a recently licensed ham; he got his general and extra license in 2017. His ham radio interests range from rag-chewing on HF to digital radio. Fred enjoys tinkering, building, and experimenting. Since day one, ham radio has been a constant learning journey about electronics and antennas.
