* **Presenter**: `Brian Day`

## Details
Brian Day, of NASA's Lunar Science Institute will tell us about NASA's next mission to the moon, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE). He will also tell how the ham community can directly help with this mission.

Our understanding of the Moon is changing dramatically as a result of findings from a new generation of robotic lunar explorers. NASA's next mission to the Moon, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), offers exciting opportunities to greatly extend our understanding of the Moon's dynamic exosphere. It also offers students and the public exciting ways to participate in science supporting the mission through observations of meteoroid impacts on the Moon and meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. In this meeting, we will take a new look at the Moon, get an overview of the LADEE mission, and discuss the unique opportunities and challenges that could be provided by forward scatter radio observations of meteors by amateur radio operators.
