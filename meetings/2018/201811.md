## Details

Have you ever wondered why and how Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves?  Well, it had nothing to do with communication, he was specifically trying to validate Faraday and Maxwell's radical theory that light was an electromagnetic wave.  This is a story of a kind and shy Englishman (Faraday) with no math skills, a charming Scotsman (Maxwell) and his talented wife who saw mathematics where no one else did (James and Katherine Maxwell) and a pessimistic German (Hertz) in a dark room with a magnifying glass.  You will never look at your radio in the same way again!

Kathy Joseph Balistreri is a Physics teacher and historian.  She is currently working on her book on the history of electricity and electronics called “The Lightning Tamers: Wild Tales of How We Electrified Our World” and makes videos on the same theme on YouTube under the name “Kathy Loves Physics”.  By far the most difficult and rewarding part of her research and studies was in the complicated and cutthroat world of early wireless telegraphy and broadcast radio.  If you have any old equipment she would love to see it!
