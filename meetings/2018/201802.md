## Details

Rachael will help us will explore the variety of components that make up a small off-grid solar setup, including batteries, solar panels, charge controllers and inverters. This will help you determine your requirements by examining the actual power used by various ham radios, household appliances and other electronic devices and what is needed to run those during short-term, mid-term and long-term power outages..

Bio: Rachel Kinoshita moved from Oregon to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989 to work for a start-up email software company and has spent most of her career working in the messaging industry.  She now spends her time fighting spam, malware and phishing attacks.

Rachel (KK6DAC) is still a newbie to ham radio, having only gotten her license in early 2013.  Although like many things, Rachel jumped in with both feet and soon got her general license, an HF rig and starting exploring the world in the low bands. 

At the same time, she found herself working with her local Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) to help develop and shape their communications plans and policies.  She also found her way to the South County ARES (SCARES) organization where she developed an interest in emergency communications.
