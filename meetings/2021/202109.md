## Details

Practically hot off the press!  This month's QST featured an article on Node-RED.  It’s all about Flow Based Programming.  Invented by J. Paul Morrison in the 1970s, flow-based programming is a way of describing an application’s behavior as a network of black-boxes, or “nodes” as they are called in Node-RED. Each node has a well-defined purpose; it is given some data, it does something with that data and then it passes that data on. So, what does this have to do with ham radio?  Andreas will show us how this open-source software can be an easy solution for controlling many applications in the ham shack.
