## Details

Lucian is a Mechanical Engineer of 30 years and is self-employed. He boasts of being an avid “boat anchor” collector since he was a student; especially military gear from WW2.  He loves to experiment with antennas and chasing DX.  That is what motivated him to build a magnetic loop as a portable multiband antenna.  Lucian lives on a small island 15 miles NW of Vancouver amongst other islands.  He enjoys setting sail in his dinghy and working DX from some of those islands.
