## Details

Digital radio is nothing new but recently, a trend has started to develop in the amateur community. The introduction of yet another non-compatible radio format makes for interesting coffee talk but really? Do we really need another one? What does all this mean and what are all the main differences. Joel will present the main differences between the competing radio formats.

First licensed in 1982 In Phoenix (KA7TXV), Joel enjoys building and home brewing rigs and antennas and spends a fair amount of his time working in the microwave bands. Joel currently serves as the technical coordinator to PAARA.
