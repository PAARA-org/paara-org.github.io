## Details

Prof. Moerner will talk about science in his youth, concentrate on the original experiment as a signal detection problem similar to FM in ham radio, and briefly mention some of the current work.

W.E. Moerner's early years as a ham in high school eventually led to the study of electrical engineering, physics, and mathematics in college and optical studies of vibrations of molecules in graduate school. All of these experiences built upon themselves throughout his career, eventually leading to the optical detection of a single molecule in a solid in 1989 at IBM Research. This was achieved with laser FM spectroscopy, which involves frequency modulating a visible light beam at low modulation index to detect narrow spectral features with quantum-limited sensitivity. Effectively, the single molecule acts as a demodulator of the FM signal, converting the FM to AM, much like good old FM radio, but at 560 THz. This was the beginning of single-molecule optical studies which are having a broad impact on imaging in chemistry, physics, and biology today.
