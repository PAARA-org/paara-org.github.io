## Details

At long last, the PAARA Repeater is FINALLY starting operation this month and with it, there will be many questions. This presentation will cover much of the details about the system, how it came about and how it came to be. The repeater we built is much like many other machines in the Bay Area but this one belongs to PAARA and is currently an all-digital machine with some amazing capabilities.

And so in celebration of PAARAs first repeater, we are announcing the current level of operation and some of the future plans. And just in time for Field Day 2016, we will finally have our very own machine for managing operations at the FD site. This talk will also include a small tutorial on DMR radio operation, what type radios will work with this systems; what to look for and where to get them. We will also have a guest speaker to meet with us to talk briefly about the NORCAL DMR group which PAARA will be a member of and how the link system works and it's current capabilities. We will also have computers for programming most of the DMR radios available on the market today, set up at the meeting and future meetings so you can bring your new radios to the meeting and get it programmed for free.
