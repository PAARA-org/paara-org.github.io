## Details

Steven, KI6MYE, is an Extra Class radio operator living in Los Altos, California. He currently serves as President of the Southern Peninsula Emergency Communication System and is an Assistant Emergency Coordinator for Los Altos Amateur Radio Emergency Services. Prior to the Youth DX Adventure, his HF experience was limited to contacts in Hawaii, Idaho, and Florida with a homemade balun and an OCF dipole hung from a swingset.

### The Youth DX Adventure

The Youth DX Adventure was launched at the end of the 2009 CQWW SSB contest. Don, N6JRL; Dave, KB8OCP; Todd, KD4YHY; Jim, AB8YK, and Keko, TI5KD, had operated the contest at TI5N, a DX vacation villa that Keko operates in Costa Rica. The purpose of the adventure would be to introduce youth operators to the world of DXing at a young age and early moment in their ham radio careers. They would do this by bringing youth operators from all over the country on a noncontest weekend to Costa Rica allowing them the opportunity to create the pileups. This would give the youths a chance to see what it feels like to be "on the other end."
