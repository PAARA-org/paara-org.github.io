## Details

For 2016 National Parks on the Air, FARS's dynamic duo of Dave and Dave activated the nonexistent ghost town of Furnace near Dante's View in the Greenwater Valley of Death Valley National Park. Exploiting an extremely low noise floor, they achieved an extremely high number of QRP contacts in stark and magnificent desert solitude.

Bio: Dave has been a ham since 1989 and currently holds an Amateur Extra license. He graduated with a BSEE from San Jose State in 1975 and spent most of his career in radio communications, working for Chevron, Farinon Electric, Ampex, and Digital Microwave. His Ham interests include: QRP ops (mostly SSB) and antennas. He likes to hike and is also interested in trains and photography.
