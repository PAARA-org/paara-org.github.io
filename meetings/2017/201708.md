## Details

Clay will be presenting an introduction to the Summits on the Air (SOTA), an international program that encourages ham radio operators to operate from, and contact stations on, more than 8,000 qualifying mountain summits around the world.  He will share lessons learned from his experiences activating 43 unique summits in the Bay Area and beyond, and will provide a demonstration of the backpack ham station that he uses on his expeditions.

Bio: Clayton has been an assistant professor in the Stanford political science department since 2011.  While finishing his Ph.D.  at Harvard, he was the station manager, Field Day organizer, and a regular contest operator at W1AF, the Harvard Wireless Club's station located in Harvard Square.  Licensed since 1994, his main interests in ham radio are CW contests, DXing, and very low power (QRP) operation.  Since arriving at Stanford, he's been a regular contributor to the club's ham radio contest efforts.
Here is a Youtube sample of operating from a local mountain top.
