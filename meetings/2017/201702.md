## Details

Originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Karl Kappler completed a B.Sc. in mathematics and physics from the University of Victoria, Canada, and MS and Ph. D. degrees in applied geophysics with an emphasis on signal processing from the University of California at Berkeley. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 2008–2011, primarily working in electromagnetic methods applied to unexploded ordnance detection and classification problems. He has been a research geophysicist in mineral and oil-and gas applications working on topics ranging from field system development, to data acquisition, processing and interpretation as a consultant as well at SJ Geophysics in Vancouver, Canada and at GMI in San Diego California. Karl is currently Chief Scientist at QuakeFinder – a humanitarian research organization dedicated to earthquake forecasting based in Palo Alto CA. His main research interests are signal and noise separation and understanding noise sources in EM measurements.
