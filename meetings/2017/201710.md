## Details

Humans, by our nature, have trouble understanding hazards and risk and taking appropriate action.  The City of Palo Alto is one of the first cities in the Bay Area to have undergone a new FEMA process that applies best management practices to these topics.  Known as the Threat and Hazards Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA), the report for the Palo Alto area may surprise you: <www.cityofpaloalto.org/thira>.

Bio: Ken Dueker, the Chief of the Office of Emergency Services (OES), will be our guest speaker to guide us through THIRA and how all of us can and should prepare for various scenarios.  The City's OES is a public safety department that not only works on such risk assessments but also deals with topics ranging from earthquakes to terrorism.
