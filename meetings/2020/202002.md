## Details

3D printers are everywhere and the filament choices are vast. The question is where to begin or how to get started without heaps or frustration and burning hard earned dollars. At first glance it will appear to be very challenging and yes, there are some things to learn to be successful. But once you make your first print, you will watch it in amazement during nearly the entire print cycle.

But getting a printer is only part of the story. Your mechanical skills and envisioning parts in 3 dimensions is the other skill you will need to grasp. Joel Wilhite - KD6W will present the case for dusting off your drafting skills and show some software tools for drawing and exporting and slicing partsfor "3D" printing, and explain why you should never buy an antenna insulator or worry about lost buttons and knobs.
