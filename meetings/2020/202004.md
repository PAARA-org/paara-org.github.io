## Details

PAARA members and friends, the next PAARA meeting (4/3/20) will be conducted using Zoom. The link below will take you directly to the meeting though you may be prompted to download Zoom onto your device first if you don't already have it installed. You can connect to the meeting using any device. As I request in the PDF Zoom meeting guide, please use your first name and callsign when connecting as well as have your microphone muted.

Download the PDF ZOOM Guide from HERE

I plan on starting the meeting by 7:15 PM so please be there by then, though you can still join late. I'll start the Zoom connection around 6:30 PM so anyone who hasn't used Zoom before can connect early to test out their connection or see what the interface looks like. 

The virtual meeting will be a bit different than a usual meeting but it will give us a chance to "get together" and chat as well as catch up with each other. At this moment, there will not be a speaker as we've not identified one that has only a PowerPoint presentation. That could change between now and the time of the meeting.
