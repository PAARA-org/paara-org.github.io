## Details

RFI happens because the wires inside equipment, and the cables that we use to connect our equipment together, can function as antennas to either radiate or receive RF trash if they carry RF current. All wires and cables function as antennas when they carry RF current, and several common equipment design errors cause this to happen.

These unintentional antennas radiate RF trash from computers, power supplies, and noisy motors, which is then picked up by our receive antennas, and we receive the RF from our ham stations. These same unintentional antennas receive the signal from our ham station and couple it into consumer equipment. We can eliminate most RFI by either eliminating that un-intentional RF current, or by causing it to flow in current loops too small to radiate efficiently.
