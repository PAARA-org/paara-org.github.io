* **Topic**: `The Ionosphere: Space Weather Monitoring`
* **Presenter**: `Ray Mitchell, KI6FYU`

## Details

### Abstract
In this introductory forum we will examine solar flares, the formation of the ionosphere, and the effects of solar radiation on ionospheric RF propagation.  The theory of SID (Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance) monitoring will be presented along with several practical approaches for "Do It Yourself" SID monitoring.  Ray will share his experiences working as Chief Engineer at Stanford University's educational program and will show the latest SID monitor: "SuperSID" that is presently made and sold as a kit by SARA (Society for Amateur Radio Astronomers.)

### Presenter
Mr. Mitchell was the chief engineer for the Solar Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance (SID) Monitor Program at Stanford University's Solar Center Education and Public Outreach 2003-2009.  Mr. Mitchell presently works at Davis Instruments in Hayward, CA and has worked over 14 years as a senior software engineer in the embedded systems, automatic test equipment, and semiconductor test fields at various Silicon Valley companies, such as Ubicom, Hewlett Packard, and Agilent Technologies.
