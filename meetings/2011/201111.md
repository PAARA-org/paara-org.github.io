## Details

The 2011 MicroLite Penguins DXpedition to South Orkney Islands, Antarctica"

In January 2011, thirteen hams and seven ship's crew ventured across the Drake Passage, long known to sailors as the "most dangerous water in the world," to establish VP8ORK on Signy in the South Orkney Islands. They found a fragile wilderness with difficult access, rugged natural beauty, abundant wildlife, and volatile weather. They made 64,000 QSOs.

Come see and hear a bit of VP8ORK. Learn about the triumphs, tradeoffs, and challenges of Antarctic DXpeditioning. Enjoy a vicarious radio adventure. Parse pileups without plodding through penguin poop. You will not get wet, cold, or seasick, but you may wish you had.

Tom Berson, ND2T, is a member of the VP8ORK team. His previous DXpeditions were to Scarborough Reef (BS7H) and Midway Island (K4M). Tom was first licensed in 1957. He serves as an AEC in Palo Alto. Tom is a member of the Northern California Contest Club, the Stanford Amateur Radio Club, and CWops. He especially enjoys the comradeship of multi-op contesting and the concentration demanded by high rate operating.
