# Software Defined Radio

* **Date**: `September 9, 2011`
* **Time**: `07:00 PM Pacific Time`
* **Topic**: `Software Defined Radio`
* **Presenter**: `Stu Phillips, K6TU`

## Details
Software Defined Radios (SDR) use a combination of hardware and software technologies to build a flexible system architecture for wireless communication. Moving the majority of the radio into software enables optimized performance and extensibility that is difficult and expensive to achieve through hardware alone.

In this presentation, Stu K6TU will provide an introduction to Software Defined Radios and then talk about applying SDR technology into a DX or Contest focused Ham station. The focus of his presentation is on the practical aspects of SDR in a real world operating environment and will touch on the benefits, integration and operating aspects he has experienced with his station in Woodside, CA.
