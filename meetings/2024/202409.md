The Adventure Radio Protocol provides a common radio frequency and tone signaling standard to make it easier for radio operators in the field to find and communicate with each other. The protocol improves on the Wilderness Protocol by adding signaling methods that allow for unattended alerting for various types of on air activities from emergencies to POTA and SOTA spotting.
