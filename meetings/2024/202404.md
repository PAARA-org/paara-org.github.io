## Details

From hardware to software, simple to complex. It doesn't matter. If you put your heart and soul into it then show it off! It is strongly suggested that you make your presentation in person to facilitate a better viewing experience.  

If you present via Zoom then it may work better if you make a PDF file of pictures and any supporting text and share that so you don't have to fumble trying to get the item(s) in the camera view.  

Presentation time may be limited due to the number of presenters so be prepared to keep your presentation under 6 minutes. 

Email Rob at kc6tyd AT gmail.com to get on the list.
Please add Subject: Homebrew and state if you will be presenting on Zoom  
Sorry, due to time constraints, we cannot accept any further presenters.
