No person may be nominated without the nominee's willing acceptance. At both of these meetings, any nominee that wishes shall be given an opportunity to solicit votes by communicating their qualifications and reasons for their running. Nominations shall be closed at the end of the November meeting.

**F**. The final slate of nominees shall be published in the December newsletter and the election shall be held at the December regular meeting by secret ballot.
