## How to add a new meeting?

1. Modify the meeting skeleton to add: 
   * topic
   * presenter
   * details
   * Zoom meeting details
   * example at <https://github.com/PAARA-org/paara-org.github.io/blob/master/meetings/2025/202506.md?plain=1>

2. Upload an image (optional) and render it inline
3. Modify `_includes/meeting-short.md` to include the same details (this will be rendered on the first page)
   * example at <https://github.com/PAARA-org/paara-org.github.io/blob/41e09eb62eccab82d7b528a0111cd3cf2c46dceb/_includes/meeting-short.md?plain=1>

### How to add Zoom meeting details

Add zoom meeting link and phone dial number to the `_includes/meeting-short.md` as in the example below::

```markdown
## Next club meeting
* **Date**: `6 June 2025`
* **Topic**: `The Legacy of Trans-Pacific Radio`
* **Presenter**: `Richard Dillman (W6AWO)`
* **Zoom Meeting**:

   * <+16699006833,,81572645379#> US (San Jose)
```

## What to do after a monthly meeting ends? Rollover to a new month!

Run the `./script/rollover-to-next-month.sh` script from the top repository location which will generate an output similar to this:

```
% ./script/rollover-to-next-month.sh
[ Step 1: Detecting next monthly meeting filename ]
  File meetings.md exists.
  Current meeting is for year(2025) month(08). Next meeting is year(2025) month(09).
[ Step 2: Deleting the current symlink ]
  Running: 'rm meetings.md' ...DONE
[ Step 3: Creating the new meeting file if necessary ]
  The file 'meetings/2025/202509.md' does not exist or is empty. Initializing from meetings/template.md ... DONE
[ Step 4: Updating the _includes/meeting-short.md file ]
  Successfully updated _includes/meeting-short.md.
[ Step 5: Updating past meeting history ]
  Running ./script/parse-past-meetings.sh ...DONE
```

## What to do when we know the topic and presenter?

Update `meetings/2025/202506.md` and `_includes/meeting-short.md` with the topic and presenter details.

## How to add presentation materials to a meeting?

For some of the meetings, we get a PDF of PPT that we can link in the meeting page (for example <https://paara.org/meetings/2025/202504.html>).

The following steps must be followed:
1. Upload the PDF or PPT into the <https://github.com/PAARA-org/paara.org-attachments> repository
   * the files must be uploaded in meetings/`YYYY`, where `YYYY` is the meeting year (meetings/`2025` for example)
   * the file name must start with YYYY`MM`, where `MM` is the month (2025`04` for example)
   * a full filename example is `meetings/2025/202501_Instant_Tuning_For_A_Manual_Tuner.pdf` or `meetings/2025/202504_Stealth_HF_Antennas_McClary.ppt`
2. In the meeting page, under the `## Presentation materials` heading, add links to the PDF in both Download and Docs Viewer mode (example at <https://github.com/PAARA-org/paara-org.github.io/blob/77a3ad09ce3f91de06af4f51ec856ad1e66e5321/meetings/2025/202501.md?plain=1#L17>)

```md
* *PDF*: [[download](https://github.com/PAARA-org/paara.org-attachments/blob/main/events/2025/202501_Instant_Tuning_For_A_Manual_Tuner.pdf?raw=true)] [[Docs Viewer](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/PAARA-org/paara.org-attachments/blob/main/events/2025/202501_Instant_Tuning_For_A_Manual_Tuner.pdf?raw=true)]
```

## How to add the YouTube to a meeting

1. Open the YouTube video in your browser
2. Click the `Share` -> `Embed` and copy the **iframe** code:

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QrTYcUS4hU?si=ImhnyzMrJMUEigxn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

3. Add this code into the particular monthly meeting file, just above the `## Presentation materials` line

4. Regenerate the past meetings index, which will add the video tag to this meeting as well:

```bash
./script/parse-past-meetings.sh > _includes/meetings-template.md
```
