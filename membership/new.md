# Becoming A New Member

Membership is available to all persons interested in Amateur radio. There is no screening process or sponsorship required to become a member. We encourage prospective members to sign up for membership at our meetings.

**`Primary` member dues are $25.00 per year which provides full membership privileges, including**:

* **Membership Roster**: A printed membership roster, containing the names of all members, and the phone numbers and E-mail addresses of those that provide the information.
* **PAARA Newsletter**: Full members get one copy of PAARAgraphs, the club newsletter, mailed to them each month. (Family memberships do not receive additional newsletters.)
* **Voting At Annual Elections**

**`Family`** member dues are just $6.00 per year. (One Primary member of the family pays the full dues of $25.00, enabling the rest of the family to join as Family members).
