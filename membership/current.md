# Current Members - Renewing Your Membership

Dues are payable in **`January`** each year.

**`Primary` member dues are $25.00 per year which provides full membership privileges, including**:

* **Membership Roster**: A printed membership roster, containing the names of all members, and the phone numbers and E-mail addresses of those that provide the information.
* **PAARA Newsletter**: Full members get one copy of PAARAgraphs, the club newsletter, mailed to them each month. (Family memberships do not receive additional newsletters.)
* **Voting At Annual Elections**

**`Family`** member dues are just $6.00 per year. (One Primary member of the family pays the full dues of $25.00, enabling the rest of the family to join as Family members).

## Option 1: Pay Online

To pay dues online, simply use the drop-down menu options below. In your shopping cart (before you check out) there will be two buttons:
1. **`Continue Shopping`**: takes you back to this page, so you can pay for an additional family member, order a name badge, etc. before checking out.
2. **`Check Out`**: takes you to the PayPal page where you have multiple ways to pay:
    * using **PayPal** by logging into your PayPal account, or,
    * using a **Credit Card**.

### Note #1
If you pay online, and then later return to your Shopping Cart, it might not automatically "empty". You may have to refresh the page to remove any previously paid items. This is a minor annoyance and still a convenient method to pay your Dues.

### Note #2
After you make your order at PayPal we will contact you by email for your name and callsign. (if you missed adding it as a comment in the order form)

## Option #2: Dues Payment using Physical Form

To pay your dues, please fill out the a Membership Form, which you can download from [here](/membership/Membership-Form-17a.pdf).

You can then bring the Form to the next PAARA meeting and give it, along with your Dues payment to Membership Coordinator, Jim Thielemann, KI6KVW, or any other Officer of the Club. If you wish to mail it in, send this form with your check made out to `PAARA` to:

    PAARA Membership
    P.O. Box 911
    Menlo Park, CA 94026
