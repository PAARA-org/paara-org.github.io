# Welcome, New Hams

We're looking forward to seeing you at our next meeting or event!

## Free Membership

As a new ham, you’re eligible for a one year free PAARA membership! Please talk to the club’s Secretary **Ric Hulett** [N6AJS](https://www.qrz.com/db/N6AJS) in person at our next monthly meeting, or by email at <secretary@paara.org>.

## Discord
We invite all PAARA members and friends to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/E2s4rez64d) and discuss anything ham radio related, such as: homebrew, [POTA, SOTA](https://paara.org/ontheair.html), digital modes, or anything else that you might be interested in.

## Newsletter

The club publishes a [monthly newsletter](https://paara.org/newsletter.html) full of interesting stories and information, with the archive going all the way back to 1971! Members get immediate access to a digital or a hard copy (mailed) delivered a few days before the monthly meeting.

## Meeting videos
We recommend you to check out our [monthly meeting archive](https://paara.org/meetings.html#past-meetings), where you’ll find video recordings of the great speakers we had over the years. Alternatively, you can browse recordings on the [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@paarapresentations-c3w) directly.
