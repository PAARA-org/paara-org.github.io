## Notes about using Dynamic Talkgroups on W6OTX

* Please use Dynamic TGs only on TS1.
* Dynamic TGs are automatically disconnected after 15min of no uplink activity.
* BrandMeister USA doesn’t anymore support use of Reflectors, but feel free to use Dynamic TG’s on the TS 1. All you need to do is key-up on the BrandMeister TG you want to connect to, and it gets connected to the repeater until the time-out.
