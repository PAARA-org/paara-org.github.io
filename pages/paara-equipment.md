## Radios & Accessories

### Elecraft KX1

![image](/images/KX1Button3.jpeg)

This Elecraft KX1 started off as a raffle prize for a PAARA meeting, but when Lucky JC won it, he donated the radio kit back to the club, and Mark, KR1PTO, donated his time to build the radio, so it is now available for club use on Field Day and during other events.

### Motorola FMTRU-41B (a)1d

This old, two-frequency tube-based VHF radio is crystaled for two frequencies: 147.450 and 145.230, although it does not have a PL tone encoder or decoder.

It is currently under repair by Andy, KR6DD. S/N: 1066

### Keys

TODO(kn6yuh): fix this list so it makes sense

There are five duplicate sets of keys for the two PAARA trailers, and these sets are kept by
1. the President, AF6TF
2. Peter, K6WEB
3. Property Manager, N6NV
4. and the fifth by Joel, KD6W.

### Morse Code Trainer

Purchased in 2004 at the beginning of the first PAARA Code Training Class, this device is available to PAARA members on a short term loan basis for random code & code speed training. Ask Terry, AF6TF for details.

### Giant Morse Code Key

Used mostly for fun, this XL wooden key patterned after a J-38 is in need of repair to make it function once again. Attached to it is an MFJ Code Practice Oscillator donated by Peter, K6WEB.

## Mobile Equipment

### Glen Baker Club Trailer

![image](/images/BigGreenTrailerButton3.jpeg)

This 1952 travel trailer, now retired, was used for our two main HF contesting stations. The trailer was named in honor of the late Glen Baker, W6UOK; a former PAARA club president who had helped purchase it and who gave so much of his time to the club.

### GOTA Trailer

![image](/images/SmallTrailerButton3.jpeg)

This small trailer (designed for the back of a pickup truck but mounted on weels of its own) is typically used for our GOTA (Get On The Air) HF station—an official part of Field Day designed to let new hams have their first HF experience.

### Utility Trailer

![image](/images/UtilityTrailerButton3.jpeg)

Donated by AMD, we plan on modifying this trailer for transporting antenna masts. Volunteers are needed to design and build the modifications. Please contact Andreas, N6NU if you have the needed skills.

## Power Generation/Distribution

### Honda EU1000i Inverter Generator

![image](/images/eu1000GeneratorButton3.jpeg)

This Honda generator weighs just 29 pounds, runs for 3.8–8.3 hours on one tank of gas, produces 7.5–8.3 amps and makes only 59 dB at a distance of 7 meters. It has two 120 V AC outlets, a DC outlet for charging 12 V batteries (not gel-cells!), and can be daisy-chained to an identical generator to increase the amperage. (Currently gone missing.)

### PE-95 10 kW WWII Trailer-Mounted Generator

![image](/images/PE-95GeneratorButton3.jpeg)

This generator is currently stored at Covington School, and since it gobbles several gallons per hour, it serves mainly as a backup.

### Onan 5 kW Trailer-Mounted Generator

![image](/images/OnanGeneratorButton3.jpeg)

This is our main generator, typically used to power both the main trailer and the GOTA trailer, as well as the coffee pot. It is equipped with a Leland 2500 alternator, and it runs at about 1,800 RPM. The engine is a Briggs & Stratton gas type that has a propensity to gobble fuel like crazy. Stored at Doug Teter's shop.

### Garod Radio Corporaration CBF-21263-?B HandCrank Generator

This is used for our natural power bonus points at Field Day.

### AC Distribution Box

![image](/images/PowerDistributionBoxButton3.jpeg)

An unknown model, this power distribution box has input and output connections of both normal 15 A household outlets and twist-lock 30 A shore power outlets.

### AC Distribution Cable

Approximately 500 pounds of 30 Amp, 3 prong, twistlock power distribution cable. Enough lengths and the adapters needed for connecting the small trailer to the generator is stored in the small trailer, and ditto for the big trailer, plus enough extra for another run, and all sorts of miscellaneous converters and regular outlet distribution boxes.
