# PAARA Resources

* [DMR and FM Repeaters](/pages/dmr-and-fm-repeaters.html)
    * PAARA operates two DMR repeaters that are connected to the BrandMeister network.
* [PAARA Equipment](/pages/paara-equipment.html)
    * Roster of club-owned equipment & documentation archive.
* [APRS](/pages/res-aprs.html)
    * APRS is a complex standard, made more complex by the scatterbrained documentation available and the many incompatibilities that have resulted from that state. This page provides direct links to the key data files, including Bay Area maps, station overlay files, the FCC callsign database, and other items that you will want to install in your copy of WinAPRS, UI-View, or Xastir, along with documentation of the more important standards.
* [Frequency Listings](/pages/res-freqlist.html)
    * Local simplex and repeater listings, including a listing of every discrete 2 meter frequency in the Bay Area, including claims to simplex usage, digital frequencies, and T-Hunts.
* [Local BPL](/pages/res-bpl.html)
    * The Menlo Park AT&T/PG&E/Main.net BPL trial has been discontinued, but another installation is planned for Milpitas.
* [N6NFI Repeater (145.230)](https://www.fars.k6ya.org/repeaters/n6nfi_r)
    * Although PAARA does not have it’s own repeater, we have adopted N6NFI (a.k.a. “the Palo Alto Machine”, “The Stanford Machine”, and “523”) as our home base.
* [SCV Section Calendar](http://www.arrl.org/Groups/view/santa-clara-valley)
    * Maintained by the ARRL Santa Clara Valley Section, this resource lists club meetings, nets, and other events
