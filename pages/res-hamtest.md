# Ham Tests & Training

[The famous CSM/Ross Peterson Ham Cram](http://www.baears.com/), sponsored by the Bay Area Educational Amateur Radio Society

BAERS provides 1-day class and testing sessions (8:00am to 4:00pm) for those interested in getting their Amateur Radio license or in upgrading their existing license. They hold three to four sessions per year, depending on interest and classroom availability, and typically offer a 95% or better pass rate. This is NOT a class. It is a guided study six 45-minute pool reading periods, with breaks and lunch. This is the most efficient way to maximize attention span against study fatigue. Classes are held in various locations, but are often at the College of San Mateo.
