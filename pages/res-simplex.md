# Simplex Operations

Because a repeater can only support one conversation at a time, it is important that you refrain from monopolizing its time.If all parties talking are close enough to communicate without the repeater, then you should move to a simplex frequency. You can check by pressing the reverse button on your radio, or whatever key sequence swaps the input and output frequencies. But which simplex frequency? Many seem to default to using the national FM calling frequencies—highlighted in the table below—but the calling frequencies are not meant for long QSOs, so they should not be the first choice. They may be appropriate for the type of communications characterized by short, disconnected tidbits (such as a talk-in) and for emergency and traffic alerts, but not much else. Given the reccomended spacing between channels used in California, the national [ARRL band plans](http://www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/bandplan.html), and the [NARCC band plans](http://www.narcc.org/Rptr_Lists/Bandplan.html) used in Northern California, we are left with the list of simplex frequencies shown in Table 1. The bands listed here may have different band plans in other states (and in Southern California), so please check the appropriate sources when travelling outside of this area.

**2 Meter Note**:
* Because of concerns over interference from adjacent channels, other states use a channel spacing of 20 kHz, while southern Nevada uses 30 kHz and Alaska uses 60 kHz. The channel spacing for each state is shown in the offset map that is part of the ARRL Repeater Directory.
* This means that the available simplex frequencies will be different in Southern California and in other states.
* For the purposes of amateur radio operations, Northern California is defined with the following boundary:
    * `North`: California–Oregon border
    * `East`: The Nevada state line and southward along the summit of the Sierra Nevada range to Tehachapi pass. Thence Southwest to the ridge line of the Sierra Madre range near Frazier Park, thence westward along the ridge line to the Pacific Ocean at a point between Santa Maria and San Luis Obispo near Pismo Beach.
    * `West`: The Pacific Ocean to the radio horizon.
