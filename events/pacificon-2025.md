## What is W1AW/6

PAARA has for many years been responsible for setting up and managing the Special Event Station for Pacificon.
For the last six years, Mikko ([AB6RF](https://www.qrz.com/db/AB6RF){:target="_blank"}) has been the PAARA member managing this task.

The Special Event Station (SES) is much like the PAARA setup for the ARRL Field Day:
* We setup typically around five HF stations, each station being locked on one specific band.
* Each station has an HF rig, logging computer, headsets, CW paddle etc. etc. and of course an antenna for that band.
* For the 10m, 15m and 20m bands we use the PAARA tower trailer and the KT43A 4-element ri-band beam.
* For the lower bands we use various wire antennas.
* Typically the CW/SSB stations also have a linear amplifier, that we usually run at around power level.

### ARRL Station Manager

The [W1AW/6](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1AW/6){:target="_blank"} call sign is made available to us by the ARRL Station Manager.
We apply for the call sign way in advance, and then get a written authorization to use it during those specific days.
The ARRL Station Manager also takes care of all QSL cards and LOTW conformations after we provide him a composite log file of all the contacts that were made during the event.

## Running the station

During the weekend, from Friday noon to Sunday noon, the SES is open for Pacificon visitors to make HF contacts under our supervision, using the [W1AW/6](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1AW/6){:target="_blank"} callsing.

A trusted PAARA member has to be present at the station at all time during the weekend to:
* Act as the official control operator
* Help and guide the visiting operators
* And to of course keep an eye on all that equipment we have out there

While PAARA has a couple HF rigs and the logging computers, the vast majority of the station equipment is loaned by PAARA members for the event.

## Volunteers needed

Here's where we need your help (as PAARA members):
1. Setting up the antennas and the tents on Thursday. We usually start around noon.
2. Station Captain duty during the weekend. We need some there at all time during the 48 hour event. Volunteering for some of those over-night hours is VERY critical.
3. And lastly, we need help tearing it all down and packing it away starting noon on Sunday.
