[Club Meeting Information & Location](/meetings.md)

The Palo Alto Amateur Radio Association was first formed in 1937, and then incorporated as a California non-profit orginization in March of 1956, and for many years has had the club callsign W6OTX, formerly held by club member and Palo Alto resident (Ramona St.) Wilbur C. Lauridsen, who died while serving in the Navy during WWII.

PAARA meets on the first Friday of every month (with an occasional exception for meeting room conflicts) at the **Cubberley Community Center**: `4000 Middflefield Road, Palo Alto, CA 94303` Telephone: `(650) 329-2418`.

In addition to the monthly club meetings, PAARA runs a weekly Net and Swap session at 8:30 pm every Monday evening on the **N6NFI** repeater (145.230, – offset, 100Hz PL), participates in the ARRL’s annual Field Day exercise during the last full weekend each June (in Menlo Park’s Bayfront Park), as well as other occasional activities.

## Callsign History

The club has had its current callsign, **W6ARA** since January 10, 2006. It was previously held by long-time PAARA member, Joel Zobel, who became a Silent Key in 1999.  Gerry, N6NV, applied for the callsign after consulting with the Zobel family, and W6ARA was finally assigned to PAARA on January 10, 2006.  The callsign was first used in the North American QSO Party four days later, on January 14, 2006 by Ron, W6AZ, who made 112 QSOs in the contest.  Since then it has been used in every Field Day event.

The club also has had the callsign **W6OTX**, since at least 1988 (the date the FCC shows for the current grant), and likely back to 1950, when the club originally requested it, to honor Wilbur C. Lauridsen, who served as the club Trustee up until the start of WWⅡ, and who was lost in action early on in the Pacific.  The club’s previous call was **W6UAM**, which was allowed to expire before the club was able to reorganize.
