PAARA's Field Day safety guidelines were written and updated for Field Day 2025 by [Rob Fenn KC6TYD](https://www.qrz.com/db/KC6TYD), the club's Field Day safety officer.

## Introduction

To facilitate the ARRL’s Field Day Safety Officer requirements, PAARA has appointed safety officers to be on site for the duration of the event. In an effort to ensure everyone’s safety during Field Day, the following information will contain abbreviated park rules and regulations, general hazards, and setup and teardown guidelines. It is expected that all volunteers, regardless of involvement, follow these guidelines.

## Bedwell Bayfront Park Rules and Regulations (Abbreviated) 

To protect our long lasting relationship with the City of Menlo Park and the park staff, we need to be conscientious and respectful of the privileges we have been granted for the entire duration of Field Day. This abbreviated list of rules and regulations must be followed by all volunteers and participants: 

* Pets are to remain on leash and under control at all times
* Bikes are restricted to paved trails and roads 
* Plants and wildlife are to be left undisturbed 
* Litter and trash are to be disposed of properly 
* Fire, smoking, alcohol, or weapons of any kind are prohibited
* Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems are not allowed
* Tents or other enclosed structures are not allowed

### Exemptions for Field Day 

* You’re allowed to park your vehicle at the designated Field Day site
* You’re allowed to remain on site past the posted park closure times

## Site Access

The main gate is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. After 9 p.m., the main gate will be closed and locked. Use the talk-in frequency (listed below) to arrange for someone to open the gate. To exit, locate the assigned gate keeper. You should expect delays; please plan ahead.

## Talk-In and Onsite Coordination Frequencies

**Talk-In:** [N6NFI repeater](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=06&ID=620), 145.230 MHz, negative offset, 100 Hz PL. 

**On-site:** Simplex 147.450 MHz. **It is strongly recommended that all Field Day staff use and monitor this frequency for onsite coordination.**

## Parking

Due to the limited space, volunteers and visitors must park along the shoulder of the road. Some of the station locations have turn outs that can accommodate a few vehicles. Drivers must park in an orderly fashion and at no time block the roadway accesses. Only designated vehicles used in the process of setup and teardown will be allowed to drive off the main roadways. Do not park vehicles with internal combustion engines in high grass due to the hazard of fire. All drivers must adhere to the posted speed limit.

## In the Event of an Emergency; First Aid Supplies

<mark>In the event of an emergency, 911 should be called immediately.</mark> In the event that EMS/Fire is needed after the main gate is locked, immediate coordination will need to take place to open the gate and to escort EMS/Fire vehicles to the Field Day site. The Safety Officer and lead coordinator shall be advised if 911 is activated. Unless otherwise stated, Safety Officer Rob Fenn, KC6TYD, will have first aid supplies available for minor emergencies.

## Weather

Ambient temperatures can be significantly high during the day. Winds can become severe in the afternoons. Individuals are encouraged to hydrate appropriately. Volunteers and participants are reminded to dress accordingly and using **layers** is recommended. Night time temperatures can be chilly. Short pants worn during the hot day may not provide the warmth you’ll need during the night.

## General Hazards

### Wildlife

The park is a wildlife refuge and as such harbors a variety of animals including snakes, skunks, and spiders. To avoid unintentional encounters with the wildlife, all volunteers shall remain on designated trails unless working at a station. It is understood that our Field Day stations and antennas will be assembled in areas that are off the main trails. As such, it is essential to always be aware of your surroundings. 

### Nighttime Activity

There is no artificial lighting at the park, and the moon will be waxing. After dusk, it will be very dark. If you are planning to be on site after dusk, you must bring a headlamp or flashlight and be extra cautious where you walk. 

### Trip Hazards

The fields at Field Day are riddled with ruts and holes from burrowing wildlife. The Safety Officer will make every attempt to fill in those holes in heavy traffic areas. During and after setup, caution must be taken to avoid trip hazards that could include tower structures, stakes, guy wires, extension cords, and cabling. Identified trip hazards as well as structures that could be walked into, will be marked. High visibility paint, flagging tapes, and cones will be used where appropriate.

## Generator Safety Guidelines and Fire Extinguishers

Each station is powered by a gas generator. Each generator will be placed far enough away from the operating position to reduce noise. A minimum perimeter of 3 feet around the generator will be clear of any vegetation. Extra fuel will be stored separately from the generator. 
A Class ABC fire extinguisher shall be placed near each generator. Station Captains and volunteers are encouraged to review the proper use of the extinguisher, such as the PASS technique: Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep. 

## Electrical Supply

## PPE, Tools, and Gear Safety

### Personal Protective Equipment

Volunteers directly involved in the assembly/disassembly of masts and towers are strongly encouraged to wear a hard hat. OSHA/ANSI standard hard hats are available for purchase on Amazon for $16. Due to the uneven terrain and the potential for injuries while working with heavy objects, wearing boots with proper ankle support are recommended. Gloves are recommended where applicable.

### Tools

Extreme caution should be taken when using tools, especially when working above other volunteers. Examples would include while standing on a ladder or while tethered to a tower. 

### Tower Climbing

Only experienced tower climbers will be allowed to climb towers and will use proper climbing harnesses doing so. 

### Ladder Use

If a large ladder is used, another volunteer must hold the ladder while the work is being done. 

## Assembly/Disassembly Guidelines for Antenna Masts and Towers

### Assembly/Disassembly captain

For each tower or antenna mast assembly/disassembly, a captain that has experience in the assembly/disassembly processes will be designated. Prior to starting, the captain will assign specific tasks to volunteers and explain the role for which they will be responsible. To eliminate any confusion the captain will be the only person calling out instructions during the assembly/disassembly. When working with the tower and masts, volunteers need to be aware of potential pinch points that could cause injury to fingers and other body parts. Caution should be taken when wearing loose clothing as they could be trapped or caught during assembly/disassembly. 

### AB-621 mast

Due to the many components involved while working with this mast, a minimum of seven volunteers is strongly recommended during assembly/disassembly. This allows for one captain, one volunteer for each guy wire, one volunteer to load the mast section onto the crank stand, and one volunteer to operate the mast brake and crank. The mast brake operator must verbalize when the brake is being placed on or off. Once the mast brake has been set, no one will touch the mast brake handle until the crank stand is brought back up and is supporting the weight of the mast.

### Tower trailer

The recommended number of volunteers to assemble/disassemble for the tower trailer is six. This allows for one captain and five volunteers to assist with guy wires, halyards, cabling, and operation the tower cranks. Wheel chocks should be placed to insure unexpected movement.

## Hospitality Canopy

A clear and flat area for the hospitality canopy is recommended. Any ruts or holes in the ground should be marked or filled with dirt. BBQs, hibachis, or any grill or stove are prohibited. Canopies and sunshades must be properly staked and secured. As stated earlier, electrical appliances will be used. Caution should be taken not to overload the circuit. A trash can should be made available for waste.
