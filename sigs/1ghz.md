# 1 GHz and Above

1 GHz and Above Organizer: Joel Wilhite, KD6W

A group specifically dedicated to those heartiest of experimenters and enthusiasts who build their own transverters from kits or spare parts in an effort to chase the most ellusive QSOs in the upper most band regions of the Amatuer bands.

Meetings ramp up as contests appear on the calendar and very informal. We usualy conveen around the need to test the equipment before going out to run a field test or operation. The main contest season revolves around the August and September wekeends designated for hte 10GHz and up contest but others include coordinating with favorable moon conditions. New contests are being added all the time.

All hams all welcome and newcomers will be surprised at how little effort is required to get started. The most expensive part is the IF rig. Many use the Yaesu FT817ND. The mani focus of this group is to help others build their contest transverters and feed horns . For more information please contact Joel Wilhite KD6W.
