# Monday Night Net

Monday night nets take place at 8:30pm on the <b><a href="https://www.fars.k6ya.org/repeaters/n6nfi" target="_blank">N6NFI repeater</a></b> (145.230 MHz (-) 100Hz).

There are two [Echolink](https://webapp.echolink.org//) nodes connected to **N6NFI**:
1. `W6REK-R` (Henry's node)
2. `KR6DD-R` (Andy's node)

The repeater has a very long squelch tail (3 seconds), and EchoLink will not allow you to transmit until that's complete. This can make it challenging to check into the net, but net control is making efforts to pause for EchoLinkers to give them a chance of checking in.

## PAARA Net History

The PAARA Net has taken many forms over the years. For many years, the club held VHF simplex nets. During the 1970s it begain at 8:15pm on 145.224 MHz—with AM modulation! (As a 1974 PAARAgraphs put it, “…no shoddy FM allowed.”) In February 1975, the net began switching to FM modulation on that same frequency. Some time later, the PAARA Net moved to 147.450 MHz simplex. After the 145.23 machine was activated, the net moved there shortly later to increase the range. On October 1st, 2009, N6NFI permanently enable the PL tone.
